# Firebase Testing
This is a simple scaffolded Angular app with some Firebase integration.

If you're learning Firebase too, this might be a good starting package for you.

If you'd like to install, simply fork or clone the project, and run `npm install`, `bower install` and then `grunt serve` and you should be in business :)
